		<h3>Things to do</h3>

		<ol>
			<li>Ask your local council if your home is built to cyclone standards.</li>
			<li>Are you adequately insured? Make sure it covers you for storm surge, flooding and cyclone damage, including clean-up and debris removal.</li>
			<li>Check your roof and repair any loose tiles, eaves or roof screws.</li>
			<li>Ensure windows are fitted with shutters or metal screens.</li>
			<li>Trim any branches hanging over your house and clear gutters of leaves and debris.</li>
			<li>Make sure your household is familiar with the Standard Emergency Warning Signal (SEWS), which is generally broadcast when a cyclone is 12 hours or less away.</li>
			<li>Decide how you will look after your pets and what you will do if you have to leave them behind.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>If you hear either a watch or a warning, you should:</h3>
		
		<ol>
			<li>
				Stay tuned to your local ABC station on a battery-powered radio and check the ABC Emergency Twitter and Facebook pages regularly for instructions and updates on the cyclone.</li>
			<li>Familiarise yourself with some of the facts behind tropical cyclones through the Bureau of Meteorology.</li>
			<li>Check that your emergency survival kit is complete and have it on hand.
			<li>Let neighbours know a cyclone watch/warning has been issued.</li>
			<li>Clear your property of all loose</li>
			<li>Secure boats. Move vehicles/bicycles under cover.</li>
			<li>Fill buckets and bath with water (in case your water supply gets cut off). Make sure you have enough water purification tablets.</li>
			<li>If your windows are fitted with shutters, make sure they are closed securely. If not, tape your windows in a criss-crossing fashion using strong packing tape (this will hold broken glass in place).</li>
			<li>Bring children and pets indoors and remain inside until told otherwise.</li>
			<li>Let friends and family know where you are.</li>
		</ol>
